# Student Backend

It is the backend of the Student-Data-FullStack web app. I have created this
rest api with `Java`,`Spring Boot`,`Gradle`. I have followed the proper industry
standard along with the javadocs. I have taken the student entity
easy as much as possible for better understanding. I also have enabled show-sql
to visualize the sql query that how operations are performed on the database
layer.If you want me to develop more or host, this project let me know.

## How to start the app?

Pull GitHub branch to your local device.Go to folder `build/libs/`.Run the
jar `java -jar student-backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
Follow documentation to use api properly.
> **Note** : MySql must be installed on your system and create a new database named `studentfullstack`.
